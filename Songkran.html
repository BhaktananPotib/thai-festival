    <p class="Text">Songkran Festival is one of the most important and joyful celebrations in Thailand. The word
      “Songkran” originates from the Sanskrit word saṃkrānti, meaning “movement” or “astrological passage.” This refers
      to the movement of the sun into a new zodiac sign, marking the beginning of the traditional Thai New Year.
      Symbolically, Songkran represents renewal, cleansing, and the opportunity to start fresh by washing away
      misfortune and showing respect to elders, family, and sacred images.</p>

    <p class="Text">The festival is held every year from April 13 to 15, though in many parts of Thailand the
      celebrations can last even longer. It is observed nationwide, with major festivities taking place in Bangkok,
      Chiang Mai, Pattaya, and Phuket. Songkran is also celebrated in neighboring countries such as Laos, Myanmar, and
      Cambodia, each with their own traditions. During this time, people engage in water-splashing activities, which
      have become the most well-known symbol of Songkran. Pouring water is not just for fun but also carries the meaning
      of purification and blessing for the year ahead.</p>
    <p class="Text">Behind the festival lies a fascinating legend. According to Thai mythology, there was once a wise
      young man named Thammabal Kumara who was challenged by the god Kapila Brahma with a set of riddles. If the boy
      failed to answer, he would lose his life, but if he succeeded, Brahma would have to sacrifice his own head.
      Thammabal answered correctly, and Brahma was defeated. However, Brahma’s head possessed dangerous power: if it
      touched the ground, it would burn the earth; if it was thrown into the sea, it would dry it up. To prevent
      disaster, Brahma’s seven daughters, known as the Nang Songkran, took responsibility for carrying his head in a
      ceremonial procession each year, washing it with holy water to keep the world safe. This myth explains the origin
      of Songkran rituals, especially the use of water as a sacred act of cleansing.</p>

    <p class="Text">Today, Songkran is both a time of fun and deep cultural meaning. While tourists enjoy the lively
      water fights in the streets, Thai families also gather at home to pay respect to elders, visit temples, and pour
      water gently over Buddha statues as a sign of reverence. The festival blends ancient traditions with modern
      celebrations, making it a unique reflection of Thailand’s cultural identity.

      In conclusion, Songkran Festival is more than just a water fight. It is a celebration of renewal, respect, and
      unity, rooted in ancient legend and spiritual belief. By combining joyful activities with meaningful rituals,
      Songkran continues to be one of the most cherished and significant festivals in Thai culture.</p>
